# Machine-Learning
It contains the ML projects that are to be made in andrew NG's famous course on machine learning

it's a set of exercises cum projects that were part of a stanford machine learning tutorial.They take you through a surface to deep understanding of
widely used algorithms,concepts and techniques in Machine learning.
These projects give you an essence of broad dimensions of the subject we are dealing with here.
Every project has a pdf file in it that amply describes the project and take you through the code's understanding.
